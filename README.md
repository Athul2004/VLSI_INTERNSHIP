# VHDL Digital Logic Components

> **Internship Project at SMEC Labs**

This repository contains initial VHDL implementations of fundamental digital logic components developed during my internship at SMEC Labs. These modules serve as essential building blocks for digital system design, verification, and simulation.  

## üöÄ Components Implemented

- **Adders**  
  - Half Adder  
  - Full Adder  
  - Ripple Carry Adder  

- **Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU)**  
  - 4-bit ALU supporting arithmetic and logic operations  

- **Multiplexers**  
  - 2:1 MUX  
  - 4:1 MUX  
  - 8:1 MUX  

- **Flip-Flops**  
  - D Flip-Flop  
  - JK Flip-Flop  
  - T Flip-Flop  

- **Counters**  
  - 4-bit synchronous counter  
  - 4-bit asynchronous counter  

- **Logic Gates**  
  - AND  
  - OR  
  - NOT  
  - NAND  
  - NOR  
  - XOR  

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

These modules are written in VHDL and can be simulated using any standard VHDL simulator such as ModelSim, Vivado, or GHDL.
