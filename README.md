# SMEC Labs VLSI Internship Projects

Welcome to my VLSI internship repository at **SMEC Labs**. This repository contains a series of VHDL-based digital design modules that I developed and simulated as part of my internship training. These designs cover a wide range of fundamental building blocks used in modern digital systems.

## üìÅ Project Overview

During this internship, I focused on the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design and simulation of essential digital logic components using **VHDL**. The projects demonstrate skills in structural and behavioral modeling, as well as a good understanding of testbenches for functional verification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implemented Modules

The following VHDL modules were developed:

- **Adders**
  - Half Adder
  - Full Adder
- **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
- **Multiplexers**
  - MUX (Multiplexer)
- **Logic Gates**
  - NOT Gate
  - NAND (implemented using AND gates)
  - AND Gate
  - OR Gate
- **Flip-Flops**
  - D Flip-Flop
  - JK Flip-Flop
  - SR Flip-Flop
  - T Flip-Flop
- **Counters**
  - 2-bit Counter using D Flip-Flop
  - Johnson Counter
  - Ring Counter
- **Shift Registers**
  - Bidirectional Shift Register
  - SISO (Serial-In Serial-Out)
  - PIPO (Parallel-In Parallel-Out)
- **Encoders**
  - Encoder

## üß™ Testing

Each module includes a VHDL testbench to verify its correctness under various input conditions. Simulations were performed to confirm functional accuracy.
